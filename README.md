Internal Equipment & Asset Management System (IEMS)

This Project is planned as a simple Portfolio Project to show how I would create a real Site using ASP.Net with EFCore and React+TS in the Frontend

How to build the Apps:
For the API:
- Go inside of the Project Folder of IEMS_API (../IEMS_API/IEMS_API)
- run "dotnet build" to build the application
- run "dotnet run" to run it. It should then be on it's respective Port

For the Client:
- Go inside the Project Folder of IEMS_Client (../IEMS_Client)
- run "npm run build" to build the site and check for errors
- run "npm run dev" to run the site in dev mode or "npm run preview" in a preview of production mode (build is necessary for preview)
